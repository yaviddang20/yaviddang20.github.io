  <section class="overview">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <h3>(a) Objective</h3>
    <p>
      This project aims to integrate, robotic manipulation, hand–eye
      calibration, and neural scene representations into a single system for automated 3D scene reconstruction. A camera is rigidly mounted to the wrist of a UR7e robot arm
      such that the camera an be actively repositioned to acquire multi-view observations of a scene. Using
      known robot kinematics and an estimated hand–eye transformation, all camera
      poses are expressed in a common world coordinate frame and used to train a
      3D Gaussian Splatting model.
    </p>

    <h3>(b) Motivation and Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      Accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction is a foundational capability for robotic perception and manipulation. Classical structure-from-motion pipelines estimate camera poses from large collections of images to reconstruct a 3D scene, making them time-consuming and data-hungry. In contrast, my approach leverages robot-provided kinematics to obtain camera poses directly, reducing the required number of images by an order of magnitude. I demonstrate how a single robot arm can autonomously capture a 3D scene that can subsequently be used to plan grasping tasks based on the resulting reconstruction. Successful deployment of this system requires both a robust scene reconstruction model and accurate transformation of the camera frame into the world frame.
    </p>

    <h3>(c) Applications</h3>
    <p>
      The resulting system is applicable to a range of robotic tasks requiring
      accurate scene understanding, including grasp planning, bin picking,
      inspection, and the construction of digital twins for simulation and motion
      planning. The core idea of this project (egocentric 3D reconstruction with a mobile component of a robot) will be increasingly useful as robots become more capable/mobile and 3D representations become a necessary component for navigation and developing world models.

  <!-- ================= DESIGN ================= -->

  <section class="features">
    <h2>2. System Design</h2>

    <h3>(a) Design Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      My system is designed to produce 3D reconstructions aligned to the
      robot base frame. This requires a rigid camera mount with minimal camera movement and a robust method of acquiring the necessary transformation between the camera optical frame and the world frame. The design also requires a 3DGS model that can reliably and rapidly reconstruct 3D scenes from a small but informative collection of images.
    </p>

    <h3>(b) Planned Design </h3>
    <p>
      An RGB camera is rigidly mounted to the wrist of the UR7e robot end-effector. A hand–eye
      calibration procedure estimates the fixed transformation between the camera
      and end-effector frames. The robot detects the ArUco tag in the center of the scene and plans a 360 trajectory around the center. Camera poses are computed via forward kinematics composed with the hand–eye transformation. The known camera poses are featurized as inputs into the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process.
    </p>

    <h3>(c) Design Choies and Trade-offs</h3>
    <p>
    Leveraging robot-provided camera poses removes the need for structure-from-motion and eliminates its associated pose-estimation errors. However, this shifts the reconstruction quality dependence to the accuracy of the camera-to-world frame transformation. I adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) instead of neural radiance fields due to its significantly faster reconstruction speed while achieving comparable visual fidelity. Although a RealSense sensor can directly capture depth to produce 3D point clouds, there is a considerable depth error and frame-to-frame inconsistency. As a result, RealSense point clouds are often irregular and poorly suited for high-quality surface reconstruction, in contrast to the smoother representations produced by 3DGS.
    </p>

    <h3>(d) Robustness, Durability, and Efficiency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Robustness:</strong> The system leverages robot kinematics for pose estimation, which encodes geometric constraints that are more reliable than feature-based matching, especially in challenging visual conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Durability:</strong> Because camera poses are obtained from robot
        kinematics rather than image matching, the system remains stable under
        low-texture scenes, lighting variation, and partial occlusions that typically
        degrade structure-from-motion pipelines.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Efficiency:</strong> By eliminating multi-view pose estimation, the
        pipeline significantly reduces image requirements and computation, trading
        real-time performance for reliable online reconstruction suitable
        for downstream grasp planning.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ================= IMPLEMENTATION ================= -->

  <section class="methodology">
    <h2>3. Implementation</h2>

    <h3>(a) Hardware Setup </h3>
    <p>
      I use a RealSense RGB-D camera, but any non-depth RGB camera suffices. I built a simple custom camera mount with two M4 through-holes to screw into the wrist end effector and a 0.5 in through-hole for the RealSense. The mount was 3D printed with polylactic acid (PLA). To connect the camera to the computer, I used an active USB hub and two cables (camera-to-hub and computer-to-hub) and velcro straps to keep the cables from interfering with perception and motion.
      
     For the scene, I used a wallet & keychain, small wood cube, green plastic cup, and a 5 cm ArUco tag. The scene was placed on top of a tabletop placed below the end-effector of the arm. The scene can consist of any object as long as the object is not too tall or too large. For robustness, I add an ArUco tag to indicate the center of the scene but the tag is not necessary if the center of the scene is directly under the end effector's default position.

    <h3>(b) Software </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>ArUco frame transformation node</strong> — Modified ArUco detection node to be a service node that detects the AR marker tag and stores the transformation from the camera to the base frame. It handles both the AR marker attached to the arm and the AR marker at the center of the scene.<br>
      <strong>Trajectory planning node</strong> — Node for planning trajectories for hand-eye calibration and scene revolving by calling MoveIt 2. This node stops for 0.25 seconds before calling the picture-taking node.<br>
      <strong>Picture-taking node</strong> — Service node that takes a picture and saves the picture and position of the camera relative to the world frame.<br>
      <strong>Modal node</strong> — Node that launches a containerized cloud environment to process RealSense images and train the 3DGS model on an A100 GPU.
    </p>

    <h3>(c) Entire Pipeline</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Hand-eye calibration</strong> — The robot arm moves into a position to detect the ArUco tag located at the base. The 15cm ArUco tag is detected and the camera-to-world frame is calculated and stored.</li>
      <li><strong>Scene center identification</strong> — (Optional if scene center is placed under end-effector and coordinates are known a priori) The arm moves into a birds-eye view position such that the 5 cm ArUco tag on the table is visible. The ArUco tag center is used as the center for step 3.</li>
      <li><strong>Circular Trajectory</strong> — The arm plans and executes a trajectory to circle around the center with a tunable radius (default 40 cm) with 9 waypoints for a total of 10 images. At each waypoint, the robot stops and the picture-taking node is called to take a picture of the scene.</li>
      <li><strong>3DGS Training</strong> — The RealSense images and camera poses are preprocessed as input to train the 3DGS model and output a 3D point cloud (.ply) file. On an A100, this step takes less than 20 seconds with 10 images.</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>3D Reconstruction Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The system produces dense 3D reconstructions with decent geometry given a sparse collection of only 10 images. The 3DGS point cloud output is depicted above. More images (either by increasing the number of waypoints or varying height of the robot arm / camera) could increase the quality of the reconstruction at the cost of increased speed. For online real-time reconstruction, the system achieves sub-20 second training times on an A100 GPU, making it suitable for rapid scene understanding and grasp planning applications.

  <!-- ================= CONCLUSION ================= -->

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project successfully demonstrates the integration of robotic manipulation, hand–eye calibration, and neural scene representations for automated 3D scene reconstruction. By leveraging robot-provided kinematics instead of structure-from-motion, I achieved accurate 3D reconstructions with significantly fewer images (10 vs. hundreds typically required). The system produces dense 3D Gaussian Splatting models in under 20 seconds, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications such as grasp planning and scene understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key contributions of this work include: (1) a complete pipeline from robot control to 3D reconstruction, (2) robust pose estimation through hand–eye calibration that eliminates the need for feature matching, and (3) efficient scene reconstruction using 3DGS that trades real-time performance for high-quality geometric representations. Future work could explore adaptive trajectory planning to optimize viewpoint selection, integration with real-time grasp planning, and extension to mobile manipulators for larger-scale scene reconstruction.
